A structured, multi-layer ASP.NET web application built using C# and .NET Framework. This project is designed to demonstrate architecture practices by separating concerns into distinct layers: Business Entities (BE), Business Logic Layer (BLL), and Data Access Layer (DAL).

## ðŸ§© Architecture

The solution follows a traditional 3-layer architecture:

- **BE (Business Entities):** Defines data models shared across layers.
- **DAL (Data Access Layer):** Encapsulates database access logic (e.g., CRUD operations).
- **BLL (Business Logic Layer):** Contains application-specific business rules and logic.
- **WebApplication4 (UI):** Frontend of the application using ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies

- ASP.NET (.NET Framework)
- C#
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Visual Studio (for development)
- SQL Server (MySQL)
